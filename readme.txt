Search backend files faster & easier! You can also tweak the Theme & Plugin Editor with custom colors, line numbering & wrapped text!

== Description ==

Search backend files faster, easier and improve your WordPress Editor experience! You can also tweak the Theme & Plugin File Editor with custom colors, line numbering & wrapped text! [Pro Version](https://www.wpbackendfilesearch.com/pro/) adds multiple file search - so you don't have to open each PHP, JS & CSS file individually to find the code you're looking for.

We built our plugin with simple, convenient features to make your Theme and Plugin Editing easier, more organized and smarter.
Features of the free version include:

= CUSTOMIZE THE EDITOR WITH COLORS & THEMES =
Change the look of your Theme and Plugin Editor in one click. We've included 33 different themes to match your favorite coding environment, like XCode, Github, Dreamweaver and more!

= LINE NUMBERING =
Keep your editor neat and organized, by automatically adding numbers to each line of code. Now you can find what you're looking for faster and easier!

= WRAPPED LINES =
No more side-scrolling! Line wrapping makes reading and editing easier, by wrapping long lines of code so they fit the width of the editor window.

> <strong>Pro Version</strong><br>
> Upgrading to the [Pro Version](https://www.wpbackendfilesearch.com/pro/) adds the ability to **Search All Backend Files** within a particular plugin or theme *at once*. You no longer have to click through each file individually to find the CSS, JS or PHP code you're looking for.

> That's a real time saver if you know the code you're looking for, but don't know where to find it.

> Find, copy & edit code you need.
> Fast. Simple. Easy.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

*You can find more FAQ on our [FAQ page](https://www.wpbackendfilesearch.com/faq-commonly-asked-questions/)*

= Where can I find documentation? =

We created some handy videos to help you install, setup and configure our WP Backend File Search & Editor Tweaks plugin. [Check them out on our Documentation Page](https://www.wpbackendfilesearch.com/documentation-resources/).

= The plugin is not working right! =

This is most commonly a caching issue - please try clearing your browser's cache. If that does not help the issue, please try clearing the cache via your WP site's caching plugin (if you have one activated). If that still doesn't solve your issue, please contact support.

= What is the difference between the Lite and Pro versions? =

You can check out a brief comparison on our [Pro page](https://www.wpbackendfilesearch.com/pro/), but the core difference is that the Pro version lets you search *all* files within a particular plugin or theme *at once*. You no longer have to click through each file individually to find the code you're looking for.

That's a real time saver if you know the code you're looking for, but don't know where to find it.

= I can't find the Theme or Plugin Editor (or, I'm getting error: "You do not have sufficient permissions to access this page") =

This could be caused by a number of issues, including a theme or plugin (or your hosting provider) blocking or disabling your editor. We recommend first clearing your cache to see if that solves the issue. If not, try deactivating all plugins and reactivating one-by-one to identify any potential conflicts *(NOTE: deactivating plugins may cause issues on your site [depending on your configuration], so we recommend backing up first and ideally testing this on a staging server)*. Once you've identified the plugin causing the conflict, contact that plugin's developer to report the bug.

== Screenshots ==

1. The WP Backend Search & Editor Tweaks plugin adds useful features to your Theme and Plugin Editor.
2. Customize the look of your theme and plugin editor in one click. We've included 33 different themes to match your favorite coding environment - XCode, Github, Dreamweaver and more!
3. Line Numbering keeps your editor neat and organized. Now you can more easily find what you're looking for.
4. With Line Wrapping, there's no need to side-scroll! Reading and editing is easier when long lines of code fit the width of the editor window.
